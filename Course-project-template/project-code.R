# packages for the project

# import the data

# data management
# can included selecting variables, cleaning variable names,
# adding labels, recoding, other cleaning or management processes


# check your work using summary()


# check assumptions for any continuous variables


# create table 1 of descriptive statistics


# create figure 1 
# outcome + predictor variable 1


# find appropriate group statistics for outcome + predictor variable 1 
# (group means & sd -OR- group medians & IQR -OR- group frequencies and percentages)
# check assumptions if needed


# create figure 2
# outcome + one of the predictor variables


# find appropriate group statistics for outcome + predictor variable 1 
# (group means & sd -OR- group medians & IQR -OR- group frequencies and percentages)
# check assumptions if needed



# create figure 3
# outcome + one of the predictor variables


# find appropriate group statistics for outcome + predictor variable 1 
# (group means & sd -OR- group medians & IQR -OR- group frequencies and percentages)
# check assumptions if needed




# for ***at least one*** of the predictors conduct the appropriate bivariate
# inferential test (one of these: chi-squared, t-test, ANOVA)
# check assumptions
# report  and interpret assumption checking results and inferential test results on the poster


# additional code for the policy brief
# can include other data sources or other analyses
